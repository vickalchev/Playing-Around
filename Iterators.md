# Four Iterators, Same Result

I crushed this kata on the second go.

If [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is new to you, it's a platform curating various coding exercises. Developers do them to practice their skills and also prep for technical interviews.

Katas is what Codewars calls their tiny exercises that call for the application of specific skills (e.g. if-statement logic, iteration, etc.).
